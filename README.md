1. **Initial Loading**
   - When you open the app, a dark purple screen with a spinning loader will appear for 3 seconds.
   - After the loading phase, the main UI will be displayed.

2. **Sidebar**
   - On larger screens, the sidebar is always visible and contains options like "NEW Chat" and past searches.
   - On smaller screens, the sidebar is hidden by default. Use the hamburger menu (`â˜°`) in the top-left corner to toggle its visibility.

3. **Translation**
   - Enter text in the main content area and click the "Translate" button.
   - Select the target language from the dropdown menu.
   - The translated text will appear below the input.

   - Enter a long text (more than 150 characters) and click the "Summarize" button.
   - A concise summary of the text will be generated.

5. **User Name**
   - The app stores the user's name locally. If no name is found, it defaults to "Guest User."
